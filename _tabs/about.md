I’m **Pramod Shanmugam Nagaraj**, a Software Developer and AI enthusiast currently pursuing my MS in Computer Science at Wayne State University (3.8 GPA). My focus is on building intelligent, high-scale applications that integrate modern DevOps practices, microservices, and advanced AI techniques to tackle complex real-world challenges.

Over the past few years, I’ve worked on cloud-native platforms supporting thousands of concurrent users, engineered real-time data pipelines that cut latency significantly, and embedded Large Language Models into core software workflows to improve user engagement. I thrive on designing end-to-end solutions—whether it’s integrating Kubernetes, Kafka, and Terraform for scalable deployments or seamlessly merging front-end frameworks with secure and performant backends.

Above all, I’m driven by the belief that AI and software engineering can create transformative technology experiences. I’m always exploring new ways to push those boundaries—combining automation, data streaming, and LLM-based enhancements to deliver robust, future-proof products.
