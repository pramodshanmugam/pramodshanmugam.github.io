**RVL**

*Technologies: C#, JavaScript, .NET, Node.js, AWS Lambda, AWS S3, Bitbucket, Kafka*

- **Data Pipeline Transformation:** Transformed the legacy live racing data pipeline by migrating from an API-based, AWS Lambda data conversion process to a Kafka-managed architecture, reducing data display latency from 7 seconds to 4.5 seconds (a 36% improvement).
- **Anomaly Detection:** Integrated an AI-assisted New Relic dashboard into the Kafka pipeline, enabling real-time anomaly detection and automated corrective API calls, decreasing incident response time by 30%.
