**Greenlight AI Recruiting Platform**

*Technologies: LiveKit, OpenAI, Python, FastAPI, Java, Spring Boot, Agentic Ai, RAG, Vector DB*

- **LiveKit Agent:** Engineered an intelligent LiveKit agent by crafting tailored prompts that dynamically generate context-specific questions from job descriptions and candidate resumes.
- **AI Integration:** Integrated OpenAI (LLM), Deepgram (TTS), and TensorFlow (turn detection) to boost candidate engagement by 30% and reduce average evaluation time by 20%.
- **Backend Services:** Developed a scalable, microservices-based backend using Spring Boot for core services (authentication, user management, interview scheduling) and an AI-focused service with FastAPI to support LiveKit API callsâ€”achieving a 40% reduction in API latency and maintaining 99.9% uptime.
